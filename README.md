# Intro
My dbt development since 2022. Apply Dimensional Design principles to develop SQL modularized architecture from source - staging - intermediate - marts - dim and fct. With 335 models, 82 analyses, 33 seeds, 86 data tests, 66 sources, and 482 macros, I developed robust, idempotent, refungible data pipelines that support production level applications for downstream business intelligence consumption answering the toughest questions and problems for the ERP system of the enterprise.
